## Student-Monthly-Budget-Tracker
This is a program that will allow any students (I would also like for others to be able to use it if they want) to plan their monthly budget based on their expenses and income. The program will assess the student's budget plans and print a message based on the evaluation.

- **As a college student myself, I find it a little hard to keep track of the amount of money that I've been spending. With this, students can be aware of how much they're spending each month on categories such as, food (eating out), groceries, outings, gas, misc., clothes, etc. Then from here, students can use the data as blueprint to help them stick to their budget.
